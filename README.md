# RubenZoedConvNetProject
A convolutional neural networks project for Dr. Zhang's CECS 456 Machine Learning Fall 2018 class.

This was made for use on @thedownhill (https://www.kaggle.com/thedownhill) 's dataset of art images, which you can find here:

Just download the dataset.zip and extract it to the same directory as the python files.
